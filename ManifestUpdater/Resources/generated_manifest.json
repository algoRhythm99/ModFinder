    "Description": "# Additional Character Names\nA mod for Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG. Adds additional random names for the RT and mercenaries in the character creator.\n\n## Overview\nThis mod expands the available pool of randomly generated names in the character creator. By default, the game splits the available names into two pools: one for the player character and one for mercenaries, resulting in only 30 available names for each sex in each pool. This mod joins both pools together and then adds a slew of additional names taken from a list [provided by Fantasy Flight](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/rogue-trader-col-ed/Official-RT-names.pdf) as supplemental material for the original tabletop RT. After removing duplicates and common/unsuitable/uninteresting entries, this results in around 300 names for males and 125 for females.\n\n## Installation\nThis is an Owlmod, made using the Unity template supplied by Owlcat. Currently the game has a bug that prevents Owlmods from working. To fix this, you ***must*** install the Unity Mod Manager-based mod [MicroPatches](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases) by microsoftenator2022. You can install it manually or via [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146).\n\nTo install this mod, first make sure you have run the game at least once. Download the archive and extract it into:\n\n%LocalAppData%Low\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\Modifications\\\nEach Owlmod needs to be in its own sub-folder in the Modifications folder.\n\nAfterwards, you need to edit OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json in the base Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader folder in a text editor (Notepad++ recommended). It should look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n\"$id\": \"1\",\n\"SourceDirectories\": [],\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\"],\n\"DisabledModifications\": []\n}\n```\n\nIf you have other mods, list them in quotes separated by commas. For example:\n\n```\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n```\n\nYou can move individual mods from the ActiveModifications section to the DisabledModifications section if you want to disable them without physically removing them.\n\nAlternatively, use [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146) to install the mod.\n\nIt should be fine to install the mod in an existing game at any point, although obviously it's primarily intended for new games.\n\n## Known Issues\nThis mod replaces the vanilla localisation strings for player/merc character names. As such, it is not compatible with any other mod that also replaces the same strings. GUIDs: `62681797-7835-4b5c-b8dd-63918881b28a` / `d109f177-8a63-40eb-8a51-dcd29d3eb94e` / `29e96169-b891-43ef-8b01-bf821656e4d7` / `566bb5f9-4e93-448a-b654-b9c2f2dc3efb`.\n\nCurrently the mod only replaces the names for the English localisation. Other languages will continue to use the vanilla set of names. If anyone wants to contribute localised versions in another language, let me know.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to the modders on the Owlcat Dicord, but particularly microsoftenator2022 and Kurufinve.\n",

    "Description": "#  Adepta Sororitas Sabbat-Pattern Helmets\nA mod for Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG. Adds several Sabbat-pattern helmets for Argenta (or mod-added Sororitas background RTs) throughout the game.\n\n## Overview\nThis mod adds the familiar Sabbat-pattern helmet employed by the Adepta Sororitas. Owlcat did initially showcase Argenta wearing one in the pre-release trailers, but for whatever reason this was removed and no longer exists in the game files. This is a new model made by me (although a hooded version uses one of Owlcat's hood models).\n\nThe mod contains four helmets. The first two - the standard base version and a hooded Celestian version - are available in chapters 2 and 4, respectively, via the Drusian vendor. The remaining two are paired with Argenta's mutually exclusive quest armours, available at the end of chapter 4. Additionally, this mod makes a minor tweak to the final cutscene/conversation of this quest to ensure that Argenta actually equips the armour she gains.\n\n## Installation\nThis is an Owlmod, made using the Unity template supplied by Owlcat. Currently the game has a bug that prevents Owlmods from working. To fix this, you ***must*** install the Unity Mod Manager-based mod [MicroPatches](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases) by microsoftenator2022.

For example:\n\n```\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n```\n\nYou can move individual mods from the ActiveModifications section to the DisabledModifications section if you want to disable them without physically removing them.\n\nAlternatively, use [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146) to install the mod.\n\nIt should be fine to install the mod in an existing game at any point right up to completing Argenta's quest in chapter 4 (or after if you're willing to use Toybox to manually spawn the helmets).\n\n## Known Issues\nAdditional localisation support has been added for non-English languages, but these have mostly been machine translated aside from those noted below. Expect errors and terrible/nonsensical grammar.\n\nThere will be some log spam after the final cutscene of Argenta's personal quest (although the vanilla version also has a bunch of error logs) seemingly due to the game trying to equip Argenta before she has rejoined the party. I did try tweaking the scene to prevent this but to no avail. Despite the error logs, everything seems to work fine. She will be wearing the armour and associated helmet for the path she's on when she returns to you (check the images tab for a screenshot).\n\nThe mod will be incompatible with any other mod that edits the CommandAction9 and CommandAction10 blueprints for the Argenta_Q2_ArgentaReturn_KTC cutscene. It's an unfortunate limitation of the way Owlmod blueprint patches work. It will probably also break (at least until I update it) if Owlcat patch those blueprints or otherwise alter the scene at some point to fix the vanilla bug.\n\nThis mod creates a save dependency! You won't be able to load a save that used it if you later uninstall the mod.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to the modders on the Owlcat Dicord, but particularly microsoftenator2022 and Kurufinve, for helping to coach me through my ineptitude in order to get the mod working.\n\nChinese localisation kindly supplied by Komoechan.\n",

While machine spirits are able to fill many tasks for which such beasts were required, the act of processing, analyzing, and synthesizing large amounts of data is beyond the ability of a mere machine.

    "Description": "Banters for the Banter God!\n<br />1. All banters are played with a mandatory response.\n<br />2. Where previously only banters tied to locations were played, banters about the relationships of party members and story-related reactions will now also appear.\n<br />3. New places where banters are played have been added (Footfall, story locations, DLC locations - wherever it was possible to add them).\n<br />4. A bonus for those who want to hear the maximum: reusable points. Until the mechanisms associated with them are fulfilled, the points work at each character/companion enter. The first pair is on the ship, in the voidship shrine (DLC location \"Shadows of the Void\"), part of the Furia mace puzzle, and here you can listen to all the banters of relationships and story reactions (you can return in every chapter, except for those played in Commorragh). The second pair is in Commorragh, in the Reaving Tempest Spire, right after entering the 2nd floor, and here you can listen to the banters of relationships and reactions to the events of Commorragh. See screenshots of the exact locations in the screenshots section.\n<br />Attention: after Furia puzzle completion (or turning off traps in Spire) banter points will stop working too. So if you want to listen, just run back and forth between plates. \n<br />5. And a new bonus for those who want to hear the maximum: some map points (\"loops\") now also play banters when clicked. See screenshots of the exact locations in the screenshots section, description - in Update1.\n<br />\n<br />Attention! Gaining achievements will be blocked when using mods. To unlock this function use mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/1]Toy Box[/url] and check the feature \"Allow Achievments While Using Mod\" (first page, section ﻿Quality of Life).\n<br />\n<br />Больше бантеров Богу Бантеров! \n<br />1. Все бантеры проигрываются с обязательным ответом.\n<br />2. Там, где ранее проигрывались только бантеры, привязанные к локациям, теперь будут появляться также бантеры о взаимоотношениях сопартийцев, и реакции на сюжет.\n<br />3. Добавлены новые места, где проигрываются бантеры (Футфол, сюжетные локации, локации DLC - везде, где получилось добавить).\n<br />4. Бонус для тех, кто хочет услышать максимум: многоразовые точки. Пока не выполнены связанные с ними механизмы, точки работают при каждом входе. Первая пара - на корабле, в святилище (локация DLC \"Тени пустоты\"), часть паззла булавы Furia, и здесь можно слушать все бантеры взаимоотношений и реакций (кроме тех, что проигрываются в Коморре). Вторая пара - в Коморре, в шпиле Опустошительной Бури, сразу после входа на 2й этаж, и здесь можно слушать бантеры взаимоотношений и реакций на события Коморры. Смотрите скриншоты точных мест в разделе скриншотов.\n<br />Внимание: после выполнения паззла на булаву (или отключения ловушек в Шпиле) бантеры также перестанут проигрываться. Так что если вы хотите слушать бантеры, то просто бегайте между точками туда-сюда.\n<br />5. И новый бонус для тех, кто хочет услышать максимум: некоторые точки на карте (\"лупы\") при клике на них теперь тоже запускают бантеры. Смотрите скриншоты точных мест в разделе скриншотов, описание - в Update1.\n<br />\n<br />Внимание! Использование модов блокирует получение достижений! Для разблокировки необходимо установить мод [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/1]Toy Box[/url] и сделать активным пункт \"Allow Achievments While Using Mod\" (первая страница, раздел ﻿Quality of Life).\n<br />\n<br />Installation guide:\n<br />1. [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases]MicroPatches mod[/url] - MANDATORY!

Unpack archive with my mod into Modifications directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader).\n<br />3.

The path will be similar to C:&#92;Users&#92;Me&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader&#92;Modifications\n<br />\n<br />Once the folder is there, you may need to edit your OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json file. This is one level up from the mod's folder. It needs to look something like:\n<br />\n<br />[code]﻿{\"$id\":\"1\",\"SourceDirectories\":[],\"EnabledModifications\":[\"jhColdTrader\",\"BigFlagship\",\"jhExpandedArchetypes\"],\"ActiveModifications\":[\"jhColdTrader\",\"jhExpandedArchetypes\"],\"DisabledModifications\":[]}\n<br />[/code]\n<br />You will need to add the two entries for jhColdTrader following the format above. Once this file is edited you can start your game and you should see the mod in the in-game mod tool (not the built in Unity Mod Manager)\n<br />\n<br />Note: This mod fixes a bug in cold trader's acumen. If you also install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/142]this mod[/url] it will double the fixed bonus, so don't, unless you want to.",

First of all, the image of the larger ships on the loadout screen had to be disabled to prevent a crash, but the screen still works normally. It doesn't update any of the ship silhouettes. It won't let you pick a DLC frigate, but if you are using one you can go back to it by selecting the Original option. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />To install, extract the folder from the .zip file and place it in C:&#92;Users&#92;[you]&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue \n<br />Trader&#92;UnityModManager. To access the options, enter ctrl+F10 to bring up the UMM menu.",

    "Description": "# EnhancedControls - mod for Warhammer 40000: Rogue Trader\n\nAdds UX related stuff. \n\nIf you're a user, downloads are on the right. See **Releases** link.\nYou can see detailed mod description on [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/14).\n\n\n## How to build\n\n1. Get the usual tools (Visual Studio and .NET development stuff)\n2. Clone the repo\n3. Build. And then Build again. Project looks up your RT installation dir from your game logs (so you need to run the game at least once).\n\nThat's it. On Build output is copied into UMM folder in appdata.\n\n\n## How to contribute localization\n\nAfter installing the mod localization files are in `Localization` folder.   \nIf you named mod install folder `EnhancedControls` then full path to them would be `%userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\UnityModManager\\EnhancedControls\\Localization`\n\nEnglish localization is in `enGB.json`\n\nCopy this file and rename new file according to the language you're translating into.\nRussian  - `ruRU.json`    \nGerman   - `deDE.json`   \nFrench   - `frFR.json`   \nChinese  - `zhCN.json`    \nSpanish  - `esES.json`   \nJapanese - `jaJP.json`   \n\n(If your system is set to hide file extensions and you don't see `.json`, then ignore that part)\n\nOpen your new localization file with any text editor - but for best results use something with syntax highlight - Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or something else.   \nChange **Text** properties to translate things.  \nStart the game in chosen language to see the effect. Or switch the language in settings, the mod will reload your changes.\n\nSend me translation file if you want me to include your translation with the mod.\n",

The goal is to provide novelty, added variety, and more interesting build decisions.\n<br />\n<br />The goal is to add abilities and talents to each of the original four tier 1 archetypes. I am trying to loosely theme these around the idea of trees, related features that build out a clear but missing niche for those paths. I am focused on tier 1 as I feel that is where broader choices belong while tier 2 is intended for specialization.\n<br />\n<br />The Soldier gets a shotgun tree and heavy weapons talents. \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Pistol Whip ability lets a ranged weapon-equipped soldier mix in some melee up close with the ability to stun the target.\n<br />[*]The Butt Strike talent gives additional damage to Pistol Whip when using a two-handed ranged weapon.\n<br />[*]The Street Sweeper talent makes pushbacks on shotgun blasts occur even on a miss.\n<br />[*]Shearing Shots adds an additional 50% overpenetration.\n<br />[*]The Gut Shot talent makes shotgun attacks on adjacent targets automatically hit.\n<br />[*]Big Guns adds 10 armor when wielding a heavy weapon.\n<br />[*]Suppressing Fire slows targets hit by heavy weapons.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Operative gets a sneaky tree and a broader foundation to build on:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Disengage ability lets the operative safely extract themselves from melee and lower their target priority\n<br />[*]The Backstab talent increases damage while the Operative is the lowest priority target\n<br />[*]The Marked Target talent leaves one exploit intact when abilities would otherwise remove them all\n<br />[*]The Vanish talent expands the Perfect Spot ability by making the operative the lowest priority target when Perfect Spot is used\n<br />[*]No Scope reduces the cost of deadeye shots.\n<br />[*]Additional attributes and skills added to level-up to allow for more diverse characters.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Officer gets a heroic self-buff tree.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Deeds Not Words is an ability that gives a full stat buff based on Fellowship.\n<br />[*]The Shield of Courage talent is a Deeds upgrade that adds armor to the buff\n<br />[*]The Guide My Hand talent is another Deeds buff that makes attacks automatically hit.\n<br />[*]The Audacity talent lets the officer substitute Fellowship for Agility in calculating Dodge.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Warrior gets a flamer tree and two-handed weapon talents.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Fuel for the Fire is an ability that triggers instances of burning on nearby targets.\n<br />[*]Pyromaniac is a talent that refunds 1 ap the first time a flame or melta weapon is used in a turn.\n<br />[*]Conflagration is a talent that adds stracks of burning based on ballistic skill.\n<br />[*]Enveloping Flames is a talent that increases the minimum damage of flame and melta weapons based on ballistic skill.\n<br />[*]Cleave Through does damage to an adjacent opponent following a kill while wielding a two-handed melee weapon.\n<br />[*]Overhead Smash increases armor penetration while wielding a two-handed melee weapon.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />You may need to respec to see changes.\n<br />\n<br />This is still a work in progress.Feel free to use the comments to suggest more additions to archetypes in the future.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />\n<br />You will need to install [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] [b]version 1.17.4+[/b] for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install it would be to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]Modfinder[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />If not using ModFinder, you will need to unzip the folder into your Game's Modifications folder.

This is one level up from the mod's folder. It needs to look something like:\n<br />\n<br />[code]﻿{\"$id\":\"1\",\"SourceDirectories\":[],\"EnabledModifications\":[\"ColdTraderOccupation\",\"BigFlagship\",\"jhExpandedArchetypes\"],\"ActiveModifications\":[\"ColdTraderOccupation\",\"jhExpandedArchetypes\"],\"DisabledModifications\":[]}\n<br />[/code]\n<br />You will need to add the two entries for jhExpandedArchetypes following the format above. Once this file is edited you can start your game and you should see the mod in the in-game mod tool (not the built in Unity Mod Manager)",

    "Description": "I happened to notice that, as of the current date/patch (1.2.19), 3 unique flamers have an attack that is not affected by the Flame Weapon Expert talent: Fiery Retribution (unique #3 attack), Purging Fury (#2 attack), &amp; the Toxic Flamer (also the #2 attack.) This resulted in a situation where those attacks cost 2 AP regardless of whether you had the talent or not. I assume this is a bug (despite the latter 2 appearing to have a normal 2nd attack, in actuality all 3 affected attacks have a unique ID, which were not on the current list of attacks the talent affects), but I can't say that definitively.\n<br />\n<br />Easiest way to install IMO is drag &amp; drop the Zip into the bottom panel of the Rogue Trader version of Modfinder.\n<br />\n<br />I'm hoping that Owlcat will fixt this issue themselves so none of us have to worry about this, but it is VERY unlikely I will devote any time to keeping this up to date unless I happen to be actively playing RT at that point in the future.\n<br />\n<br />A rather niche fix in the grand scheme of things that I made mostly for myself, but I thought someone out there might find useful. It happens to be my first &amp; probably? only mod I'll ever publish. Hopefully someone else will get a use out of it!\n<br />\n<br />Update 12/24/24:\n<br />1.) I realized the version # I listed on the Nexus (1.4) was apparently mismatched w/ the \"real\"/functional version # (1.0.4). I attempted to update the Nexus listing to correct the error. Given that I'm rather inexperienced w/ all of this, I'm not fully sure when/if this will be reflected in Modfinder and/or if this will result in some weird \"ghost versions\" lingering about in the Nexus systems. Anyway, there were no actual changes to the mod itself, just an update to the proper version # in the Nexus listing.\n<br />\n<br />2. According to their patch notes, Owlcat fixed the Toxic Flamer's #2 attack in patch 1.3.0.47 , but I couldn't find any mention of changes for the other 2 flamers this mod affects. As such, this appears to be redundant if you only wanted the fix for the Toxic Flamer, but is probably? still needed for the other 2. I say probably bc I've not really tested the mod in any way post-patch other than booting the game up &amp; checking the character screen (I'm waiting for the DLC to push through another full playthrough). Anyway, the character screen says the AP reduction is still functioning &amp; I didn't see any observable issues w/ the affected flamers from there, so AFAIK it still appears to be functioning more or less as it was pre-patch.",

The desperate version of triage has issues right now so it just does what the heroic does for now.\n<br />\n<br />Lives are spent freely on the battlefields of the Imperium, but they are not wasted. A soldier who can take back up their lasgun is more valuable than one bleeding out in the mud. Tending to survivable injuries and relieving those whose wounds are not is the task of the Medicae. These driven battlefield chiurgeons carry an array of wound treatments and combat drugs which have returning soldiers to the line as their only purpose - long term outcomes are beyond their charge.\n<br />\n<br />The medicae is a new tier 1 archetype for rogue traders and companions. It includes entirely new active abilities and talents and introduces a new team role to the party as well as the ability to bring back fallen teammates during combat and an attempt at bringing a pet mechanic into the game (pre-Lex). \n<br />\n<br />The medicae has the following active abilities:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Battlefield Medicine[/b] - The medicae heals an adjacent ally for (Medicae/4)+(Medicae/10) wounds.

Ends movement for the turn.\n<br />[*][b]Medevac[/b] - An ally up to 6 cells away moves to the closest adjacent cell.\n<br />[*][b]Combat Drugs[/b] - This ability adds 20% of the medicae's medicae skill to the target's Strength, Toughness, and Agility for 2 turns.\n<br />[*][b]The Emporer's Peace[/b] - The medicae can deal fatal damage to an adjacent incapacitated enemy (One who is stunned or can't act).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The medicae's momentum ability is Triage:[list]\n<br />[*][b]Triage[/b] - This ability heals all allies 50% of their maximum wounds.\n<br />[*][b]Triage[/b] (Desperate) - This ability heals all allies 50% of their maximum wounds but deals 50% of the medicae's wounds to themself.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 1)[/b] - All allies are instead healed to full wounds.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 2)[/b] - Allies targeted by Triage are immune to fatal wounds for one turn.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 3)[/b] - Triage also removes burning, bleeding, and toxin from allies.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 4)[/b] - Triage adds a 10% boost to the medicae's medicae skill for the rest of the combat.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The medicae's talents:[list]\n<br />[*][b]Well-Stocked[/b] - The medicae has 50% chance to not use a charge when using a medikit.\n<br />[*][b]Diagnosticar[/b] - Battlefield Medicine heals an additional 5% per dot on the target.\n<br />[*][b]Anatomist[/b] - The medicae gains a medicae skill/5 bonus to critical hit chance with chain weapons and needle weapons.\n<br />[*][b]Amputate[/b] - Melee hits with chain weapons cause carouse/15 levels of bleeding to the target.\n<br />[*][b]Bonesaw[/b] - The damage bonus with chain weapons is based on carouse skill instead of strength.\n<br />[*][b]Precocious Servoskull[/b] - The Apothecarion Servoskull can be used on allies up to 10 cells away.\n<br />[*][b]Stay Low[/b] - Using To the Rescue makes the medicae the lowest priority target for one turn.\n<br />[*][b]Reanimator[/b] - The target of Resuscitate gains an additional 10% of the medicae's medicae skill wounds.\n<br />[*][b]Overmedicate[/b] - The target of Battlefield Medicine gains the medicae's medicae skill/10 temporary wounds in addition to normal healing.\n<br />[*][b]Innoculate[/b] - The target of Combat Drugs gains +10 to all resistances for 2 rounds.\n<br />[*][b]Chiurgeon[/b] - Battlefield Medicine has a chance to clear one trauma on the target.\n<br />[*][b]Bad Medicine[/b] - Successful attacks with needle weapons add additional toxin stacks equal to 10% of the medicae's medicae skill.\n<br />[*][b]Synskin Grafter[/b]- When the medicae uses Battlefield Medicine on an ally, that ally gains 5% armor for the remainder of combat..\n<br />[*][b]First Responder[/b] - The medicae adds their perception bonus to initiative rolls.\n<br />[*][b]Help is on the Way[/b] - Using To the Rescue does not provoke attacks of opportunity from adjacent opponents.\n<br />[*][b]Now or Never[/b] - The medicae's medicae skill is increased by 10% when momentum is below 50.\n<br />[*][b]Combat Veteran[/b] - Increase the medicae's resolve by the number of medicae abilities known.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The medicae can select assassin, executioner, master tactician, or overseer in tier 2.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />You will need to install [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] [b]version 1.17.6+[/b] for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install it would be to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]Modfinder[/url]﻿.

    "Description": "The Operative is currently significantly weaker than other T1 archetypes, this mod significantly buffs Operative's abilities and makes the behavior flow together better. The new Operative leans heavily into debuffing support paired with very high single target damage. Their exploits are no longer consumed on hit and provide a team-wide damage boost but their overall damage boost for the Operative is generally lower, but their real damage output now comes from Expose Weakness. Expose Weakness keeps the team-wide damage boosts from exploits for the turn it's active in addition to stripping armor, dodge, parry, and block while massively boosting the damage of the Operative's next attack plus granting additional boosts according to the number of stacks removed. Along with general improvements to weaker abilities and talents this should help reinforce the Operative's strengths as a single-target damage specialist and debuffer while still retaining their defined weaknesses of limited mobility and multi-target damage.\n<br />\n<br />Note that this is currently in a beta state; there may be bugs or weird balancing.\n<br />\n<br />Installation Instructions:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Download ModFinder ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146[/url]﻿)\n<br />[*]Open ModFinder\n<br />[*]Drag the mod zip file into ModFinder\n<br />[*]Mod is now installed. You may need to close and reopen Rogue Trader to see any changes.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Overall changelist is as follows:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Exploit: No longer removed on hit. Stacks increase all damage taken by 5%, including for damage over time and from allies. The operative deals +5 + PER% per stack instead. Exploits from multiple Operatives stack, however Operatives only gain bonus damage for their own stacks and cannot remove stacks from other Operatives.\n<br />[*]Expose Weakness: Now increases damage by 5% per stack, debuff scaling changed to a flat -5% armor, parry, block, and dodge. Casts of Expose Weakness now stack between uses by the same Operative, although duration is not increased by subsequent casts. After using Expose Weakness, the Operative's next attack vs the target deals an additional +(10 + stacks) x PER% damage and provides further boosts based on the number of weaknesses on the target:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]3+ stacks: The attack auto-hits\n<br />[*]6+ stacks: The attack auto-crits and ignores deflection\n<br />[*]10+ stacks: The operative regains 2 AP and can make an extra attack this turn\n<br />[/list][/list][list]\n<br />[*]Joint Analysis: No longer removes exploits, instead adds an exploit when allies hit an enemy, but limited to one proc per enemy per turn.\n<br />[*]Precise Attack: No longer requires exploits to work. Scaling 15 + 3 * exploits% -&gt; 10 + 2 * PER%. Now also reduces dodge. Now additionally applies 2 exploits.\n<br />[*]Informed Hit: Critical hits with Precise Attack apply an additional stack of exploit. Auto-crit threshold 10 - INT -&gt; 6 - INT/2.\n<br />[*]Insightful Precision: Scaling changed to flat +5 perception when using Precise Attack\n<br />[*]Intimidation: Scaling 5 + PER/2% -&gt; 15 + PER%, but no longer doubles vs low armor. Also reduces MP by 3.\n<br />[*]Terrifying Presence: Killing a target with Intimidation now also extends the range to LoS.\n<br />[*]Perfect Spot: Applies exploits to all enemies in LoS at the start of the Operative's turn.\n<br />[*]Tactical Knowledge: No longer removes all stacks when cast vs a single target. Armor scaling 1% -&gt; 1 + INT/5%. Damage scaling 2% -&gt; 2 + INT/2%. Stacks between multiple casts.\n<br />[*]Improved Tactics: New effect, adds a stack of Tactical Knowledge at the start of combat and grants +1 additional stacks when using Tactical Knowledge.\n<br />[*]Dismantling Attack: Applies 6 stacks of Exploit Weakness instead of applying a -30% penalty to armor, dodge, parry, and block and gains the first hit damage bonus of Exploit Weakness. Dismantling Attack also makes Exploit Weakness no longer expire from the target.\n<br />[*]Comprehensive Analysis: New effect, analyze enemy distributes half the stacks of exploit on enemies within 5 tiles. If there are no enemies within 5 tiles those exploits are placed on the main target.\n<br />[*]Continuous Analysis: New effect, applies exploits on combat start and on extra turns in addition to at the start of normal turns.\n<br />[*]Inflict Despair: Triggers if enemy has exploit and expose weakness -&gt; triggers if enemy has expose weakness.\n<br />[*]Joint Offense: Scaling INT/2% -&gt; 2 + INT/2%\n<br />[*]Passive Learning: New effect, grants +1 intelligence when an enemy with an exploit dies.\n<br />[*]Reactive Study: Doesn't require an exploit to proc (not a change in behavior, in-game tooltip doesn't reflect actual behavior)\n<br />[*]Sharpshooter: Scaling every 5 tiles -&gt; every 4 tiles. Works only on single shots -&gt; works on all attacks, but only on the first attack of bursts.\n<br />[*]Tide of Excellence: Gains stacks when hitting a target with an exploit -&gt; gains stacks when removing exploits or killing a target with an exploit.\n<br />[*]Aeldari Ranger Sight: Doesn't inflict permanent expose weakness, extends the duration of expose weakness by 1 round.\n<br />[*]Omnissiah's Providence: Inflict 1 exploit and expose weakness after attacking -&gt; cast exploit weakness on targets before attacking\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Source can be found at [url=https://github.com/Mawootad/OperativeRework]https://github.com/Mawootad/OperativeRework[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Localizations are not provided on a volunteer basis as I only speak English at a level fluent enough to perform localization.

Those should now be added by default.\n\n## Usage  \nTo use:\n  \n1. **Before you start the character creation:** Click the button in the PlayableX mod section of the UnityModManager GUI (opened with **CTRL**+F10).\n2. Turn the toggle for the wanted origin on on.\n3. Now start creating a new character\n\n## Additional Information  \n* Because the custom origins don't have any Darkest Hours and Moments of Triumph I've unlocked all of them for the customs.\n* I know that Navigator get a Custom Portrait. I've left the Portrait Choices by default since variety is way higher that way. If you want the Navigator one you can just export that one using ToyBox and import it as a Custom Portrait.\n",

We will keep at it until it gets solved, but I am making this visible again in the meantime with this caveat. If you are still not getting these events, check the discussion thread for the .16 workaround.]\n<br />\n<br />Looking for more opportunities to use your flagship? Need a little more variety in your events? \n<br />\n<br />This mod adds space battles to the lists of events which can occur during a warp jump, similar to the shipboard battles with you and your companions. They should come up about as often in each of the three difficulty levels, though red paths will see them more often, as that set only had three events to begin with. Otherwise there is a roughly 10-20% chance of them spawning one of the several events per level*. You will encounter a variety of opponents with challenge ratings that scale with the route difficulty (the orange red route fights are tough**). \n<br />\n<br />* A note on how random warp encounters work - they're not actually random. Well, they're a little random. Each route difficulty has its own event table. Within the table events begin the game with about a 3-5% chance of happening each. The first roll in your save file is a genuine random chance. However, when an event is triggered, that option goes to a 0% chance and every other event gets boosted slightly, and so on for every event you draw. So an event you have seen has a very low chance of recurring, but gets progressively higher and events you have not seen will have the highest likelihood of occurring, eventually becoming almost unavoidable. This type of selection algorithm is good because it eventually gives you every event (probably) and lowers the odds of you getting repeats over fairly long periods (except red routes, red routes only have 5 events even after I added some so they're weird). The thing about this mod is that it injects the new events into the existing table in the middle of that state, so depending how far you are into the game, and how many jumps you made, you may get a run of these then not see them again for a while, or you might  not see them for a fair few jumps at all. The optimal way to use the mod is to add it either at the start of the game or in act 2, but you can add it at any time. It's a bad idea to remove it though. keep a pre-mod save.\n<br />\n<br />** Beware, the battles can be very hard early game. In order to make it easier to avoid them if you aren't ready but still need to take hard routes, I've made the avoid the fight option have no consequences.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important[/b]: You will need to install [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] [b]version 1.18 or higher [/b]for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install it would be to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]Modfinder[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />If not using ModFinder, you will need to unzip the folder into your Game's Modifications folder.

[url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] is a hard requirement, it is needed for this mod to load properly. (Optional but highly recommended: [b]Give Micro some love[/b]! Things like this mod, and many others mods, would not be possible without him!)\n<br />\n<br />3. It should go without saying for any mod, but especially for a game as long as Rogue Trader, but use at your own risk. Not every interaction in the campaign has been tested so there's always the potential for bugs.\n<br />\n<br />Less Important Note:\n<br />\n<br />There may be some animation funkiness. Specifically, Pasqal has hunched idle animations to show off his back pain. As the rogue trader or mercenary you have no chronic back pain and will stand upright unless holding a really heavy omnissiah axe. For female character models, they're super strong and carry their Omnissiah axe slightly off the ground. Sadly I don't have any ideas of how to fix or change this, if anyone has any ideas as to how to adjust those animations feel free to let me know!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=Lawngreen]Installation Instructions:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=3]Installation Ezmode:[/size][/color]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Make sure you have MicroPatches installed\n<br />[*]Download this mod: Tech Priest Overhaul Version.zip\n<br />[*]Go download the wonderful [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]ModFinder [/url]﻿\n<br />[*]Launch Modfinder, and drag and drop the .zip file into the section labeled \"Drag zips here to install\"\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=Darkorange][size=3]Installation Hardmode:[/size][/color]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Make sure you have [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]Micropatches[/url]﻿ installed\n<br />[*]Download this mod: Tech Priest Overhaul Version.zip\n<br />[*]Extract the Mods .zip file to the following folder location:\n<br />C:&#92;Users&#92;&lt;your user&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader&#92;Modifications\n<br />[*]Now navigate to C:&#92;Users&#92;&lt;your user&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader&#92;\n<br />[*]Find the file named \"OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json\" and edit it in a text editor like notepad\n<br />[*]Add this mod's folder name (or whatever name used in step 3) to that json file, it would go after the \"EnabledModification\":[\n<br />For example: EnabledModifications\":[\"Tech Priest Overhaul\",\"Second Mod Folder\", etc.][/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]Installation Tech-Priest Litany:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[font=Georgia][color=#1e84cc][size=3][i]\"We beseech the nexus and humbly ask to receive thy knowledge in compressed form.\n<br />Redirection of request to nearby geographical cogitator array has been confirmed.\" \n<br />[/i][/size][/color][/font][font=Georgia][color=#999999][size=3][b]*Rub ligature oil on robes* [/b][/size][/color][/font][font=Georgia][color=#1e84cc][size=3][i]\n<br />The holy data has been received, praise be to the Omnissiah!\n<br />\"We now call upon the seventh of zip to unveil this archive and bestow its blessed knowledge upon us.\"\n<br />[/i][/size][/color][/font][font=Georgia][color=#999999][size=3][b]*Use thurible to disperse incense towards cogitator*[/b][/size][/color][/font][font=Georgia][color=#1e84cc][size=3][i]\n<br />\"We now chant our directory upon which we preach our new directives to the holdings of application data of the lowest local.\n<br />It is with unity we locate the manager of all authorized modifications, by\n<br /> which we relay our holiest of instructions retrieved from the nexus.\"\n<br />\"May the machine spirit approve of thy transfer of data!\"\n<br />\"By the will of the Machine God we disclose to the sons of J the index of \n<br />change upon which was bestowed to the manager of all authorized \n<br />modifications.\n<br />It is by the Omnissiah's will that we have completed the holy ritual of data modification and installation. \n<br />Praise be to the Omnissiah!\"[/i][/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=Lawngreen][size=5]Detailed Description/Notes:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=4]Notes on Balance:[/size][/color]\n<br />Firstly let me acknowledge that YES, this mod is very likely on the overpowered side of things. I've done my best to keep things reigned in and hopefully nothing stands out as too ridiculous, maybe there are even some things that aren't as strong as they should be. I'm no game designer, and this is a LONG game to try and find sweet spots for keeping things balanced throughout the whole experience, my priority with this mod though was to have lots of interesting options that are ultimately fun and meaningful. \n<br />\n<br />By all means, share with me your thoughts on this kit's balance, whether you think it's too strong/weak, or maybe you're just having a good ol' time, let me know :)\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=4]Abilities:[/size][/color]\n<br />Some of the Tech-Priest's talents were turned into abilities, similar to how Navigator/Psyker (and now Arbitrator) has origin abilities.\n<br />Here is a summary of what each of them does, with the specific abilities in the screenshots section of the mod.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][u]Manipulator Mechadendrite:[/u][/b]\n<br />1AP (1 turn CD) Attack that deals damage, has amour penetration, and a chance to knock the enemy prone[*][b][u]Medicae Mechadendrite:[/u][/b]\n<br />1AP (1 turn CD) Ability that heals wounds and fresh injuries.

Both cost 0AP'Optical Mechadendrite' marks an enemy which then gains a stack of 'cognition points' for every single target attacks/abilities affecting them.'Record observations' is then used to collect the points from the target onto the tech priest, stacking up to 6 times.When the tech priest attacks with a weapon, if they have 3 or more stacks, they consume those 3 stacks to gain an extra weapon attack for the turn.[*][b][u]Utility Mechadendrite:[/u][/b]\n<br />2AP (2 turn CD) ability that creates a zone of incense. While allies are in that zone, they gain several benefits according to what equipment they have (armour type and weapon(s) type)Any enemies that enter the zone make a toughness check or become blinded.[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=4]Talents:[/size][/color]\n<br />This section covers the specifics of all the talents whether new, changed, or unchanged.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Acceleration Protocol:[/b] +INT Bonus Initiative, (1+INT/3) bonus MP.

Proceed at your own discretion.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=4]Original Talents that changed:\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />This section is just for anyone that might think \"Where did X original feature go?\" or \"Why would you change this?\" So I talk a bit about the specific changes and why I made them. My goals were typically to make things more accessible to a hyrbid melee/ranged playstyle, or to fill gaps I felt Pasqal had in his kit (the original plan was not to release it as its own origin, but I guess feature creep got the better of me!)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />1. [b][u]Acceleration Protocol:[/u][/b] The upfront MP bonus changed from +INT Bonus to +(1+INT/3) for less extreme scaling. I added +INT Bonus Initiative since Pasqal suffers from low initiative and wants to put points into Intelligence rather than Agility.\n<br />\n<br />The +(INT Bonus/2) MP next round per melee attack I changed into +(1+INT/3)MP for the current round for the first successful attack. Rather than banking movement next round (which often goes wasted once you attack), I made the effect the current turn and also allowed ranged weapons to get the benefit. This lets you more easily reposition after an attack, which further enables the idea of fighting with both ranged and melee weapons.\n<br />\n<br />2. [u][b]Aiming Protocols[/b] and [b]Prediction Protocols[/b][/u] (Combined into Prediction Protocols): Aiming Protocols originally provided +(5+INT Bonus) Ballistic skill, and +(10+INT Bonus) dodge reduction with plasma/melta weapons. Prediction Protocols provided +(15+INT bonus)% Dodge and Parry reduction with melee weapons, with the effect stacking per dodged/parried attack.\n<br />\n<br />I combined these two since a hybrid playstyle requires twice as many features to try and make viable. With these combined you can use it regardless of whether you're focusing pure ranged, pure melee or a mix of both. I removed the stacking effect mostly because the original talent (in vanilla without any mods) doesn't actually work. So I suppose I didn't change anything there, I just didn't fix it.\n<br />\n<br />3. [u][b]Close-Up Scanning[/b] and [b]Machine Spirit Scan Protocols[/b][/u] (Combined into Machine Spirit Scan Protocols: Close-Up scanning originally applied machine spirit communion effect on enemies with Pasqal's melee attacks. Machine Spirit Scan Protocols applied one exploit when applied to enemies.\n<br />\n<br />Originally I had hoped both of these combined would work well together. Turns out it did not make pasqal's melee attacks apply exploits with the combination like I expected it to based on the descriptions. So what I did was combined the two talents, made it apply to both ranged and melee, and added the exploit effect like the description seemed to imply.\n<br />\n<br />In testing, this one might actually be a bit TOO strong, as you can stack tides of  pretty quickly with it, and always have at least +20%ish extra damage with each 'hit' against a target. But let me know what you folks think when you try it. I say, let operatives have a bit of fun, they deserve it! (I also made this skill only show up for operatives since it has to do with exploit\n<br />\n<br />4. [b][u]Filtering Protocols[/u][/b] -&gt; renamed to \"Energy Recycling\": If you remember way back at release, this would restore 1AP ANY time a plasma or melta skill was used and was extremely OP. Then Owlcat, understandably, nerfed it to once per round. To make it a tad better I extended the effect to not just plasma/melta, but also Power weapons, as well as any tech priest ability. Additionally once your tech use is 150+, you gain 2AP instead of 1, so that you feel rewarded for stacking Tech-Use other than just being a Tech-Use skill monkey.\n<br />\n<br />5. [b][u]Manipulator Push:[/u][/b] Changed into an ability from a talent, see more information in the abilities section further below\n<br />\n<br />6. [b][u]Medicae Mechadendrite:[/u][/b] Same as above, changed into an ability from a talent, see more information in the abilities section further below\n<br />\n<br />7. [b][u]Overcharge Protocols:[/u][/b] Every time Pasqal used Plasma or Melta weapons, damage with those weapons was increased by +(5+INT bonus)% and stacks infinitely. You lost all stacks if you spent a turn without shooting.\n<br />\n<br />One thing to note about how it functions currently in non-modded RT: The tooltip says +(5+INT)% per stack, BUT, the skill behind the scenes is actually stacking +(2xINT Bonus)% per stack which is nuts the higher your Intelligence is. For example, with 150 Intelligence with 10 stacks of overcharge, the tooltip claims it should be 15% per stack for a total of 150% damage. In reality you're getting 30% per stack for 300% damage.\n<br />\n<br />So this is the first talent that I really 'nerf' so to speak, in that I changed the stack limit from 99 to 15. I've updated the description to reflect the damage bonus is +(2xINT bonus)%, I've also included a buff icon so you can see your current stacks. I've extended the effect to include power weapons to help you stack quickly, and cater to that melee/ranged hybrid style. Lastly instead of worrying about losing all stacks for a round without attacking, I've just changed it to lose 1 stack at the  of each turn as your gear 'cools' down so to speak.\n<br />\n<br />This was the one talent I was on the fence about changing, but I figure if you've blasted your way through non-modded tech-priest, hyperstacking overcharge to insane numbers, you're probably looking for a change in playstyle anyway.\n<br />\n<br />8. [b][u]Scanner Mechadendrite[/u][/b] -&gt; Augmetic Enlightenment: Original effect was +10 Perception. Neat. What I did was changed it to 5 Perception +1 for every Tech-Priest talent and ability. This is basically the same effect as Unnatural Allure on Cassia (+5 Fellowship, +1 for every navigator talent/power), except to put it in perspective, Cassia has 19 navigator talents and 15 powers to choose from. This mod gives Tech-Priest 13 (11 if not operative) talents and 5 abilities to choose from.\n<br />\n<br />Also, the Scanner Mechadendrite 'model' itself has been moved to a new ability called \"Optical Mechadendrite\", see more information in the abilities section further below\n<br />\n<br />9. [b][u]Skirmish Protocols:[/u][/b] Still has original effect of +(10+INT bonus)% damage and armour penetration with melee weapons while under the effects of machine spirit communion. Beyond this I wanted to add a defensive effect that also incentivizes casting machine spirit scan protocols. What I came up with was to have enemies with the debuff not get melee superiority against the tech priest (which was a huge PIA to do from the unity side of things). I'm still a bit iffy on this one, doesn't feel as interesting as I hoped, but let me know what you guys think!\n<br />\n<br />10. [b][u]Utility Mechadendrite[/u][/b] -&gt; Renamed to Utility Upgrade: The original effect was just +10 Tech-Use and Demolition. Firstly, I moved the effect to a new talent called \"Utility Upgrade\" because the actual Utility Mechadendrite is now an ability. Utility Upgrade also requires the Utility Mechadendrite ability before you can take this talent.\n<br />\n<br />The effect I also changed from +10 Tech-Use and Demotion, to +10 Tech-Use and Logic. Per the original talent's description, the utility mechadendrite is equipped with tools to communicate with machine spirits. So Logic instead of Demolition seems more appropriate for dealing with machine spirits which are essentially 'code' driven entities. Along those lines I also added the effect to this talent that decreases Machine Spirit Communion cost by 1AP since that would be useful while sticking with the theme.\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=4]New Talents:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This is a list of brand new talents that I added to hopefully help fill some gaps in the kit, or the ranged/melee hyrbid style of play\n<br />\n<br />1. [b][u]Armour Integration Ports:[/u][/b] Gives Heavy and Power Armour Proficencies, requiring 80 Tech-Use. If you wanted to run heavy or power armour Pasqal, you have to go VERY far out of your way to get him the Heavy Armour strength requirements. But tech-priests shouldn't need raw strength, they simply need the technical know-how to get and use stronger augmetics.\n<br />\n<br />The talent giving both heavy and power armour is mostly because I find it annoying you have to get both separately. Once you finally get power armour you either have to respec, or suffer the pain of having wasted a talent on a proficiency you won't use anymore (maybe that's intentional by design, but I just don't like it!)\n<br />\n<br />2. [b][u]Ballistic Servo Automation:[/u][/b] Allows the Tech-Priest to make ranged weapon attacks without ending movement. This one might be quite strong as an origin talent, but I mean...the Tech-Priest has a whole ballistic servo arm, why should they need to worry about stopping to aim when they shoot? Right?\n<br />\n<br />But more importantly, this helps with dual weapon combat so that when you fire a ranged attack, you're not stuck without a good way to get in close to then get your secondary melee attack.\n<br />\n<br />3. [b][u]Parallel Execution Subroutines:[/u][/b] The second weapon attack from Dual-Weapon Combat talent no longer costs extra AP. Not much to say here, just a nice way to conserve AP if going all in on dual weapon combat style. The original plan was to also remove the WS/BS penalties to the secondary attack like Dual-Weapon Specialist does but...Fun fact: Dual-Weapon Specialist LIES! It SAYS it removes the penalty, but I've seen behind the curtain O_O it does no such thing!\n<br />\n<br />4. [b][u]Tactical Servo protocols:[/u][/b] The Tech-Priest can fire their ranged weapon while in melee. This is for the opposite situation as to Ballistic Servo Automation, if you find yourself doing a melee attack and then want to dual weapon use a ranged, you're trapped in melee so you need to be able to fire while in melee. This talent is dependent on the manipulator mechadendrite ability with the idea that an extra arm would help give you the space needed to fire a ranged weapon while in the thick of it.\n<br />\n<br />[color=Aquamarine][size=4]Abilities:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />All of the 4 mechadendrites were turned into origin abilities. I liked the idea other origins had of adding universal abilities to any career choice. Sometimes on Pasqal I didn't feel like any particular operator, or overseer ability is all that useful for the build. This gives you more options to choose from so you don't feel like you have a 'dead' pick on an ability level up.\n<br />\n<br />An additional note about the mechadendrite abillities, all of them include the character mechadendrite models when taken, similar to the talents. Also corrected it so that if you respec it (SHOULD) properly removes those mechadendrites if you don't have that ability anymore. (May have mixed results if you play with the mechadendrite settings through toybox or redress)\n<br />\n<br />1. [b][u]Manipulator Mechadendrite[/u][/b] (Originally was the Manipulator Push Feature): The only things that changed about the manipulator push ability is that it is now 1AP instead of 2AP (2AP for this ability was ridiculous), and instead of a push it's a scaling skill check to knock the enemy prone.\n<br />\n<br />I prefer the prone rather than push mostly because it can be rough trying to chase down a target you just pushed away. Also the DC check for enemies falling prone from push is a mystery to me, so I went with something that's a bit more clear. (If you know how the prone DC check on push mechanics works, I'd love to know!)\n<br />\n<br />2. [b][u]Medicae Mechadendrite[/u][/b] (Was originally a talent): The original ability only healed wounds during combat, and was a whopping 2AP. This ability didn't make much sense to me when compared with Invigorate that was 1AP, healed for more, and also healed debuffs and could be used out of combat to clear fresh wounds.\n<br />\n<br />What I changed was made it 1AP instead of 2, allow it to heal all fresh injuries and then wanted to make a way to turn regular medikits into a way to heal traumas (especially since traumas are a problem without good solutions in Act 1 and beginning of act 2). The idea is that the tech-priest can use medikits to stock up on meidcae supplies for their mechadendrite that can then be used to heal traumas and old injuries. The efficiency of this abillity scales with Medicae skill level.\n<br />\n<br />Even with all this, I'm not 100% sold on this ability, I'm thinking it may need some kind of debuff removal, but it's difficult for me to add that without it becoming even more wordy than it already is. (I have a problem with making wordy abilities it seems!)\n<br />\n<br />3. [b][u]Optical Mechadendrite:[/u][/b] The model for this mechadendrite was originally the scanner mechadendrite. One of the things Pasqal struggles with in particular is number of attacks per turn, so I wanted to add an interesting way for him to be able to get an extra weapon attack. If you've never played Mechanicus, it had a system where you collected Cognition Points from enemies and tech in the environment, and you spent those cognition points on attacks. I wanted to make this skill somewhat of a 'nod' to that mechanic, but not quite as simple as JUST collecting the points. The idea is you mark a target, see how they react to various external forces and effects, and then collect that data and leverage it against them.\n<br />\n<br />The optical mechadendrite having a 2 turn cooldown is so that you're not necessarily guaranteed an extra weapon attack every round. If you plan a good turn and take the time to collect the max data (6 stacks), then you're set for an extra attack this round and the next. Collect data has a 1 turn cooldown instead of 2 in case you want to wait a turn before collecting the cognition points.\n<br />\n<br />If you've made it this far in the notes, here's a tip...for some reason expose weakness applies like 3 stacks of cognition points instead of 1. Don't know why, probably won't try to fix that, so use it to your benefit :)\n<br />\n<br />4. [b][u]Utility mechadendrite:[/u][/b] Was originally a talent, made it into a new ability, moving the talent stats to 'Utility Upgrade'. So apparently utility mechadendrites have electrically powered censors that can puff incense fumes, used both for working with machines/machine spirits as well as offensively to blind enemies. I figured I wanted an ability that is more on the support side of things, so made it into a zone of incense that can bless ally equipment. I wanted the effects to complement the individual weapon and armour types in interesting way, so hopefull I've accomplished that! Let me know what you think of this one.\n<br />\n<br />5. [b][u]Refractor Field:[/u][/b] Technically not a mechadendrite, but when browsing through FX I saw some cool force field stuff that I wanted to use. So the ability itself sounds quite strong, and I imagine if you get to 10+ stacks when using it, you might feel it's a bit OP (not sure yet!). What I will say, is that lots of enemies use burst attacks, and it doesn't matter if it's a 1 damage hit, or a 100 damage hit, one stack is always removed. The abiilty is also 2AP, so you dedicate a lot of your turn to use it. To make a comparison, late game \"Endure\" from warrior absorbs both ranged and melee damage, and with high enough armour the number of attacks it can absorb will likely be higher other than an occasional large hit here or there.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Anyway, same as all the other abilities, let me know what you think!\n<br />\n<br />That's it! If by some miracle of the Omnissiah you made it this far into the description, you truly have the blessed mind of a Tech-Priest. May your canticles always compile without error, your litanies avoid the 404th message, and most of all, may the cycle be discontinued!\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thank you to all the folks who have helped me and answered my many dumb layman questions in the modding channel of the Owlcat Discord!\n<br />[size=1]I do not own the rights to the art used in the main mod image of Opticon-22.

    "Description": "Ever wanted to play a soldier officer? an operative warrior? Why not? \n<br />\n<br />This mod makes the core 4 tier 1 archetypes (Operative, Officer, Soldier, Warrior) available in tier 2 using the expanded 20 level format for that tier, giving you many more build combinations to explore.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also includes the settings needed to bridge this mod with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/177]Expanded Archetypes [/url]and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/208]Medicae[/url], allowing these mods to provide their benefits to each other. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />You will need to install [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] [b]version 1.17.6+[/b] for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install it would be to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]Modfinder[/url]﻿. Download the .zip file and drag it into the Modfinder window or select it from the list.\n<br />\n<br />If not using ModFinder, you will need to unzip the folder into your Game's Modifications folder. The path will be similar to C:&#92;Users&#92;Me&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader&#92;Modifications\n<br />\n<br />Once the folder is there, you may need to edit your OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json file. This is one level up from the mod's folder. It needs to look something like:\n<br />\n<br />[code]﻿{\"$id\":\"1\",\"SourceDirectories\":[],\"EnabledModifications\":[\"jhT1T2\"],\"ActiveModifications\":[\"jhT1T2\"],\"DisabledModifications\":[]}\n<br />[/code]\n<br />You will need to add the two entries for jhT1T2 following the format above. Once this file is edited you can start your game and you should see the mod in the in-game mod tool (not the built in Unity Mod Manager)",
