    "Description": "# Additional Character Names\nA mod for Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG. Adds additional random names for the RT and mercenaries in the character creator.\n\n## Overview\nThis mod expands the available pool of randomly generated names in the character creator. By default, the game splits the available names into two pools: one for the player character and one for mercenaries, resulting in only 30 available names for each sex in each pool. This mod joins both pools together and then adds a slew of additional names taken from a list [provided by Fantasy Flight](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/rogue-trader-col-ed/Official-RT-names.pdf) as supplemental material for the original tabletop RT. After removing duplicates and common/unsuitable/uninteresting entries, this results in around 300 names for males and 125 for females.\n\n## Installation\nThis is an Owlmod, made using the Unity template supplied by Owlcat. Currently the game has a bug that prevents Owlmods from working. To fix this, you ***must*** install the Unity Mod Manager-based mod [MicroPatches](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases) by microsoftenator2022. You can install it manually or via [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146).\n\nTo install this mod, first make sure you have run the game at least once. Download the archive and extract it into:\n\n%LocalAppData%Low\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\Modifications\\\nEach Owlmod needs to be in its own sub-folder in the Modifications folder.\n\nAfterwards, you need to edit OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json in the base Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader folder in a text editor (Notepad++ recommended). It should look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n\"$id\": \"1\",\n\"SourceDirectories\": [],\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\"],\n\"DisabledModifications\": []\n}\n```\n\nIf you have other mods, list them in quotes separated by commas. For example:\n\n```\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdditionalCharacterNames\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n```\n\nYou can move individual mods from the ActiveModifications section to the DisabledModifications section if you want to disable them without physically removing them.\n\nAlternatively, use [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146) to install the mod.\n\nIt should be fine to install the mod in an existing game at any point, although obviously it's primarily intended for new games.\n\n## Known Issues\nThis mod replaces the vanilla localisation strings for player/merc character names. As such, it is not compatible with any other mod that also replaces the same strings. GUIDs: `62681797-7835-4b5c-b8dd-63918881b28a` / `d109f177-8a63-40eb-8a51-dcd29d3eb94e` / `29e96169-b891-43ef-8b01-bf821656e4d7` / `566bb5f9-4e93-448a-b654-b9c2f2dc3efb`.\n\nCurrently the mod only replaces the names for the English localisation. Other languages will continue to use the vanilla set of names. If anyone wants to contribute localised versions in another language, let me know.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to the modders on the Owlcat Dicord, but particularly microsoftenator2022 and Kurufinve.\n",

    "Description": "This is my first (and not the last I hope) attempt to add some more reactivity for backgrounds, part one is for Prologue. Great thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/users/867208]RomeoReject[/url], who translated mod to english, so now all english-speaking people can try it too. If you see errors in text, feel free to tell me about it, i'll fix it. If you wanna translate it to some other languages, you're welcome.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Mostly its \"I know this already\" stuff, like Navi Officer knows about Navigators or Psyker knows about danger of the warp. Psykers got some discipline-related reactivity, at least 1 for all disciple. \"Choosing Conviction\" scene got some changes (texts only, sorry again, animations are too complex for me). And 2 more points where you can get new epilogue bookpage. :)\n<br />\n<br />Попытка добавить чуток реактивности для предысторий, часть первая - Пролог. В основном, хоть какой-то способ убрать тупые вопросы типа \"Что такое Навигатор?\" для нависов, немножко \"типичных\" реакций, чуть-чуть мест, где у псайкеров работает дисциплина, теперь все дисциплины имеют минимум по одной точке. Несколько переписала сцену с выбором конвикшена (катсцену не трогала, это для меня слишком сложно). Ну и добавила парочку мест с досрочным получением эпилога. :)\n<br />\n<br />Installation guide:\n<br />1. [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases]MicroPatches mod[/url] - required. Create a directory MicroPatches in UnityModManager directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader), and unpack archive with latest release there.\n<br />2. Unpack archive with my mod into Modifications directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader).\n<br />\n<br />3. Create \"OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json\" file in the &lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\n<br />4. Open it with notepad and paste { \"EnabledModifications\": [\"AddReactivityProlog\"] } \n<br />OR\n<br />3. [url=https://github.com/CasDragon/ModFinder/releases/]Modfinder[/url] - get latest release, unpack it somewhere in your computer, run and manage your RT mods.\n<br />\n<br />Updating guide:\n<br />Delete mod directory with previous version before installing new one, because I renamed almost all files (for more compatibility with next official updates).",

    "Description": "#  Adepta Sororitas Sabbat-Pattern Helmets\nA mod for Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG. Adds several Sabbat-pattern helmets for Argenta (or mod-added Sororitas background RTs) throughout the game.\n\n## Overview\nThis mod adds the familiar Sabbat-pattern helmet employed by the Adepta Sororitas. Owlcat did initially showcase Argenta wearing one in the pre-release trailers, but for whatever reason this was removed and no longer exists in the game files. This is a new model made by me (although a hooded version uses one of Owlcat's hood models).\n\nThe mod contains four helmets. The first two - the standard base version and a hooded Celestian version - are available in chapters 2 and 4, respectively, via the Drusian vendor. The remaining two are paired with Argenta's mutually exclusive quest armours, available at the end of chapter 4. Additionally, this mod makes a minor tweak to the final cutscene/conversation of this quest to ensure that Argenta actually equips the armour she gains.\n\n## Installation\nThis is an Owlmod, made using the Unity template supplied by Owlcat. Currently the game has a bug that prevents Owlmods from working. To fix this, you ***must*** install the Unity Mod Manager-based mod [MicroPatches](https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases) by microsoftenator2022.

For example:\n\n```\n\"EnabledModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n\"ActiveModifications\": [\"DPAdeptaSororitasSabbatHelmet\", \"ModName2\", \"ModName3\"],\n```\n\nYou can move individual mods from the ActiveModifications section to the DisabledModifications section if you want to disable them without physically removing them.\n\nAlternatively, use [ModFinder](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146) to install the mod.\n\nIt should be fine to install the mod in an existing game at any point right up to completing Argenta's quest in chapter 4 (or after if you're willing to use Toybox to manually spawn the helmets).\n\n## Known Issues\nAdditional localisation support has been added for non-English languages, but these have mostly been machine translated aside from those noted below. Expect errors and terrible/nonsensical grammar.\n\nThere will be some log spam after the final cutscene of Argenta's personal quest (although the vanilla version also has a bunch of error logs) seemingly due to the game trying to equip Argenta before she has rejoined the party. I did try tweaking the scene to prevent this but to no avail. Despite the error logs, everything seems to work fine. She will be wearing the armour and associated helmet for the path she's on when she returns to you (check the images tab for a screenshot).\n\nThe mod will be incompatible with any other mod that edits the CommandAction9 and CommandAction10 blueprints for the Argenta_Q2_ArgentaReturn_KTC cutscene. It's an unfortunate limitation of the way Owlmod blueprint patches work. It will probably also break (at least until I update it) if Owlcat patch those blueprints or otherwise alter the scene at some point to fix the vanilla bug.\n\nThis mod creates a save dependency! You won't be able to load a save that used it if you later uninstall the mod.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to the modders on the Owlcat Dicord, but particularly microsoftenator2022 and Kurufinve, for helping to coach me through my ineptitude in order to get the mod working.\n\nChinese localisation kindly supplied by Komoechan.\n",

While machine spirits are able to fill many tasks for which such beasts were required, the act of processing, analyzing, and synthesizing large amounts of data is beyond the ability of a mere machine.

    "Description": "Banters for the Banter God!\n<br />1. All banters are played with a mandatory response.\n<br />2. Where previously only banters tied to locations were played, banters about the relationships of party members and story-related reactions will now also appear.\n<br />3. New places where banters are played have been added (Footfall, story locations, DLC locations - wherever it was possible to add them).\n<br />4. A bonus for those who want to hear the maximum: reusable points. Until the mechanisms associated with them are fulfilled, the points work at each character/companion enter. The first pair is on the ship, in the voidship shrine (DLC location \"Shadows of the Void\"), part of the Furia mace puzzle, and here you can listen to all the banters of relationships and story reactions (you can return in every chapter, except for those played in Commorragh). The second pair is in Commorragh, in the Reaving Tempest Spire, right after entering the 2nd floor, and here you can listen to the banters of relationships and reactions to the events of Commorragh. See screenshots of the exact locations in the screenshots section.\n<br />Attention: after Furia puzzle completion (or turning off traps in Spire) banter points will stop working too. So if you want to listen, just run back and forth between plates. \n<br />\n<br />Больше бантеров Богу Бантеров! \n<br />1. Все бантеры проигрываются с обязательным ответом.\n<br />2. Там, где ранее проигрывались только бантеры, привязанные к локациям, теперь будут появляться также бантеры о взаимоотношениях сопартийцев, и реакции на сюжет.\n<br />3. Добавлены новые места, где проигрываются бантеры (Футфол, сюжетные локации, локации DLC - везде, где получилось добавить).\n<br />4. Бонус для тех, кто хочет услышать максимум: многоразовые точки. Пока не выполнены связанные с ними механизмы, точки работают при каждом входе. Первая пара - на корабле, в святилище (локация DLC \"Тени пустоты\"), часть паззла булавы Furia, и здесь можно слушать все бантеры взаимоотношений и реакций (кроме тех, что проигрываются в Коморре). Вторая пара - в Коморре, в шпиле Опустошительной Бури, сразу после входа на 2й этаж, и здесь можно слушать бантеры взаимоотношений и реакций на события Коморры. Смотрите скриншоты точных мест в разделе скриншотов.\n<br />Внимание: после выполнения паззла на булаву (или отключения ловушек в Шпиле) бантеры также перестанут проигрываться. Так что если вы хотите слушать бантеры, то просто бегайте между точками туда-сюда.\n<br />\n<br />Installation guide:\n<br />1. [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases]MicroPatches mod[/url] - MANDATORY! Create a directory MicroPatches in UnityModManager directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader), and unpack archive MicroPatches-Mod with latest release there (MicroPatches-Editor is for modders only).\n<br />\n<br />2.

Once this file is edited you can start your game and you should see the mod in the in-game mod tool (not the built in Unity Mod Manager)",

See **Releases** link.\nYou can see detailed mod description on [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/14).\n\n\n## How to build\n\n1. Get the usual tools (Visual Studio and .NET development stuff)\n2. Clone the repo\n3. Build. And then Build again. Project looks up your RT installation dir from your game logs (so you need to run the game at least once).\n\nThat's it. On Build output is copied into UMM folder in appdata.\n\n\n## How to contribute localization\n\nAfter installing the mod localization files are in `Localization` folder.   \nIf you named mod install folder `EnhancedControls` then full path to them would be `%userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Owlcat Games\\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\\UnityModManager\\EnhancedControls\\Localization`\n\nEnglish localization is in `enGB.json`\n\nCopy this file and rename new file according to the language you're translating into.\nRussian  - `ruRU.json`    \nGerman   - `deDE.json`   \nFrench   - `frFR.json`   \nChinese  - `zhCN.json`    \nSpanish  - `esES.json`   \nJapanese - `jaJP.json`   \n\n(If your system is set to hide file extensions and you don't see `.json`, then ignore that part)\n\nOpen your new localization file with any text editor - but for best results use something with syntax highlight - Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, or something else.   \nChange **Text** properties to translate things.  \nStart the game in chosen language to see the effect. Or switch the language in settings, the mod will reload your changes.\n\nSend me translation file if you want me to include your translation with the mod.\n",

    "Description": "I happened to notice that, as of the current date/patch (1.2.19), 3 unique flamers have an attack that is not affected by the Flame Weapon Expert talent: Fiery Retribution (unique #3 attack), Purging Fury (#2 attack), &amp; the Toxic Flamer (also the #2 attack.) This resulted in a situation where those attacks cost 2 AP regardless of whether you had the talent or not. I assume this is a bug (despite the latter 2 appearing to have a normal 2nd attack, in actuality all 3 affected attacks have a unique ID, which were not on the current list of attacks the talent affects), but I can't say that definitively.\n<br />\n<br />Easiest way to install IMO is drag &amp; drop the Zip into the bottom panel of the Rogue Trader version of Modfinder.\n<br />\n<br />I'm hoping that Owlcat will fixt this issue themselves so none of us have to worry about this, but it is VERY unlikely I will devote any time to keeping this up to date unless I happen to be actively playing RT at that point in the future.\n<br />\n<br />A rather niche fix in the grand scheme of things that I made mostly for myself, but I thought someone out there might find useful. It happens to be my first &amp; probably? only mod I'll ever publish. Hopefully someone else will get a use out of it!\n<br />\n<br />Update 12/24/24:\n<br />1.) I realized the version # I listed on the Nexus (1.4) was apparently mismatched w/ the \"real\"/functional version # (1.0.4). I attempted to update the Nexus listing to correct the error. Given that I'm rather inexperienced w/ all of this, I'm not fully sure when/if this will be reflected in Modfinder and/or if this will result in some weird \"ghost versions\" lingering about in the Nexus systems. Anyway, there were no actual changes to the mod itself, just an update to the proper version # in the Nexus listing.\n<br />\n<br />2. According to their patch notes, Owlcat fixed the Toxic Flamer's #2 attack in patch 1.3.0.47 , but I couldn't find any mention of changes for the other 2 flamers this mod affects. As such, this appears to be redundant if you only wanted the fix for the Toxic Flamer, but is probably? still needed for the other 2. I say probably bc I've not really tested the mod in any way post-patch other than booting the game up &amp; checking the character screen (I'm waiting for the DLC to push through another full playthrough). Anyway, the character screen says the AP reduction is still functioning &amp; I didn't see any observable issues w/ the affected flamers from there, so AFAIK it still appears to be functioning more or less as it was pre-patch.",

    "Description": "Lives are spent freely on the battlefields of the Imperium, but they are not wasted. A soldier who can take back up their lasgun is more valuable than one bleeding out in the mud. Tending to survivable injuries and relieving those whose wounds are not is the task of the Medicae. These driven battlefield chiurgeons carry an array of wound treatments and combat drugs which have returning soldiers to the line as their only purpose - long term outcomes are beyond their charge.\n<br />\n<br />The medicae is a new tier 1 archetype for rogue traders and companions. It includes entirely new active abilities and talents and introduces a new team role to the party as well as the ability to bring back fallen teammates during combat and an attempt at bringing a pet mechanic into the game. \n<br />\n<br />The medicae has the following active abilities:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Battlefield Medicine[/b] - The medicae heals an adjacent ally for (Medicae/4)+(Medicae/10) wounds.

Ends movement for the turn.\n<br />[*][b]Medevac[/b] - An ally up to 6 cells away moves to the closest adjacent cell.\n<br />[*][b]Combat Drugs[/b] - This ability adds 20% of the medicae's medicae skill to the target's Strength, Toughness, and Agility for 2 turns.\n<br />[*][b]The Emporer's Peace[/b] - The medicae can deal fatal damage to an adjacent incapacitated enemy (One who is stunned or can't act).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The medicae's momentum ability is Triage:[list]\n<br />[*][b]Triage[/b] - This ability heals all allies 50% of their maximum wounds.\n<br />[*][b]Triage[/b] (Desperate) - This ability heals all allies 50% of their maximum wounds but deals 50% of the medicae's wounds to themself.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 1)[/b] - All allies are instead healed to full wounds.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 2)[/b] - Allies targeted by Triage are immune to fatal wounds for one turn.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 3)[/b] - Triage also removes burning, bleeding, and toxin from allies.\n<br />[*][b]Triage (Upgrade 4)[/b] - Triage adds a 10% boost to the medicae's medicae skill for the rest of the combat.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The medicae's talents:[list]\n<br />[*][b]Well-Stocked[/b] - The medicae has 50% chance to not use a charge when using a medikit.\n<br />[*][b]Diagnosticar[/b] - Battlefield Medicine heals an additional 5% per dot on the target.\n<br />[*][b]Anatomist[/b] - The medicae gains a medicae skill/5 bonus to critical hit chance with chain weapons and needle weapons.\n<br />[*][b]Amputate[/b] - Melee hits with chain weapons cause carouse/15 levels of bleeding to the target.\n<br />[*][b]Bonesaw[/b] - The damage bonus with chain weapons is based on carouse skill instead of strength.\n<br />[*][b]Precocious Servoskull[/b] - The Apothecarion Servoskull can be used on allies up to 10 cells away.\n<br />[*][b]Stay Low[/b] - Using To the Rescue makes the medicae the lowest priority target for one turn.\n<br />[*][b]Reanimator[/b] - The target of Resuscitate gains an additional 10% of the medicae's medicae skill wounds.\n<br />[*][b]Overmedicate[/b] - The target of Battlefield Medicine gains the medicae's medicae skill/10 temporary wounds in addition to normal healing.\n<br />[*][b]Innoculate[/b] - The target of Combat Drugs gains +10 to all resistances for 2 rounds.\n<br />[*][b]Chiurgeon[/b] - Battlefield Medicine has a chance to clear one trauma on the target.\n<br />[*][b]Bad Medicine[/b] - Successful attacks with needle weapons add additional toxin stacks equal to 10% of the medicae's medicae skill.\n<br />[*][b]Synskin Grafter[/b]- When the medicae uses Battlefield Medicine on an ally, that ally gains 5% armor for the remainder of combat..\n<br />[*][b]First Responder[/b] - The medicae adds their perception bonus to initiative rolls.\n<br />[*][b]Help is on the Way[/b] - Using To the Rescue does not provoke attacks of opportunity from adjacent opponents.\n<br />[*][b]Now or Never[/b] - The medicae's medicae skill is increased by 10% when momentum is below 50.\n<br />[*][b]Combat Veteran[/b] - Increase the medicae's resolve by the number of medicae abilities known.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The medicae can select assassin, executioner, or master tactician in tier 2.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Notes:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]This is an extremely involved mod and I couldn't test every circumstance.

They are living anathema to psykers, daemons, and creatures of the Warp, with their mere presence painful for both friends and foes alike. All living creatures feel extreme discomfort in their presence, experiencing a natural hostility toward the Blank, generally condemning the Pariah to a brief and lonely life.\"[/quote]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Even though it doesn't make much sense for the story of the game — starting from the prologue itself —  you can play as a possessor of the Pariah Gene: a Null is the opposite of a psyker and one of the most powerful mutation in Warhammer.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Psychic Null[/b] - The character is immune to warp damage, psyker spells and perils of the warp.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]Anti-Psyker Aura[/b] - The characters adiacent to the Pariah are immune to warp damage, psyker spells, perils of the warp, can't use psyker abilities  and deals -100% warp damage.

    "Description": "# Playable X  \nMakes the Navigator, Tech Priest and Adepta Sororitas origins pickeable for your Rogue Trader at Game Start.\nThis might also enable you to recruit multiple Navigator mercenaries.\n\nChanges compared to the previous single versions:\n\n* After character creation finished, it should now automatically disable the option.\n* Some people suggested a few things for PlayableTechPriest on Nexus (including Reject the Flesh 1 feature, TechPriestOccupation_Feature and Backpack_techpriest visual). Those should now be added by default.\n\n## Usage  \nTo use:\n  \n1. **Before you start the character creation:** Click the button in the PlayableX mod section of the UnityModManager GUI (opened with **CTRL**+F10).\n2. Turn the toggle for the wanted origin on on.\n3. Now start creating a new character\n\n## Additional Information  \n* Because the custom origins don't have any Darkest Hours and Moments of Triumph I've unlocked all of them for the customs.\n* I know that Navigator get a Custom Portrait. I've left the Portrait Choices by default since variety is way higher that way. If you want the Navigator one you can just export that one using ToyBox and import it as a Custom Portrait.\n",

The total number of changes is more than two hundred, you can get full list in Files section (Patch Notes ENG).\n<br />Immediately, an explanation:\n<br />a) I don't touch everything about character development and combat - the Owlcats themselves are actively changing this part.;\n<br />b) everything about the locations is not available in the editor I use.;\n<br />c) cutscenes can be repaired in very limited way, since most of their assets are related to b).\n<br />\n<br />Это моя попытка избавить игру от некоторых застарелых багов, добавить контент, который почему-то не добавили, и несколько улучшить подачу нарратива тут и там. Общее число изменений - более двухсот, полный список можно скачать в разделе файлов (Patch Notes RU)\n<br />Сразу же пояснение: \n<br />a) все, что касается развития персонажей и боевки, я не трогаю - эту часть Совокоты и сами активно меняют;\n<br />b) все, что касается устройства локаций, недоступно в редакторе, которым я пользуюсь;\n<br />c) катсцены могу чинить в очень ограниченных объемах, поскольку большая часть их содержимого - это то, что относится к пункту b.\n<br />\n<br />Installation guide:\n<br />1. [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches/releases]MicroPatches[/url] - MANDATORY! I'm serious, my mod cant work without brilliant Micro and his hard work. Create a directory MicroPatches in UnityModManager directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader), and unpack archive MicroPatches-Mod with latest release there (MicroPatches-Editor is for modders only).\n<br />\n<br />2. Unpack archive with my mod into Modifications directory (&lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader).\n<br />3. Create \"OwlcatModificationManagerSettings.json\" file in the &lt;Users&gt;&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;AppData&#92;LocalLow&#92;Owlcat Games&#92;Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\n<br />4. Open it with notepad and paste { \"EnabledModifications\": [\"Project_BugFix\"] } \n<br />OR\n<br />2. [url=https://github.com/CasDragon/ModFinder/releases/]Modfinder[/url] - get latest release, unpack it somewhere in your computer, run and put archive with my mod in the section \"Drop zip here\". \n<br />\n<br />Updating:\n<br />Just unpack new version over Project_BugFix directory in Modifications, when asking about overwrite click Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Special thanks: again, Micro! Almost all my work wouldn't be possible without him. \n<br />And another thanks: Owlcats, their game (and their bugs) are very inspiring :)",

    "Description": "Hey Kids! There is a patching issue with this mod and Micropatches 1.17.6 that will be sorted out. In the meantime to make it work you need to, once per save, go and install version 1.1, install Micropatches 1.17.4, load the save, save again, then you can quit and reinstall 1.17.6. \n<br />\n<br />Looking for more opportunities to use your flagship? Need a little more variety in your events? \n<br />\n<br />This mod adds space battles to the lists of events which can occur during a warp jump, similar to the shipboard battles with you and your companions. They should come up about as often in each of the three difficulty levels, though red paths will see them more often, as that set only had three events to begin with. Otherwise there is a roughly 10-20% chance of them spawning one of the several events per level*. You will encounter a variety of opponents with challenge ratings that scale with the route difficulty (the red route fights are tough). \n<br />\n<br />* A note on how random warp encounters work - they're not actually random. Well, they're a little random. Each route difficulty has its own event table. Within the table events begin the game with about a 3-5% chance of happening each. The first roll in your save file is a genuine random chance. However, when an event is triggered, that option goes to a 0% chance and every other event gets boosted slightly, and so on for every event you draw. So an event you have seen has a very low chance of recurring, but gets progressively higher and events you have not seen will have the highest likelihood of occurring, eventually becoming almost unavoidable. This type of selection algorithm is good because it eventually gives you every event (probably) and lowers the odds of you getting repeats over fairly long periods (except red routes, red routes only have 5 events even after I added some so they're weird). The thing about this mod is that it injects the new events into the existing table in the middle of that state, so depending how far you are into the game, and how many jumps you made, you may get a run of these then not see them again for a while, or you might  not see them for a fair few jumps at all. The optimal way to use the mod is to add it either at the start of the game or in act 2, but you can add it at any time. It's a bad idea to remove it though. keep a pre-mod save.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important[/b]: You will need to install [url=https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/MicroPatches]MicroPatches[/url] [b]version 1.17.4 or higher [/b]for this mod to work.\n<br />\n<br />The easiest way to install it would be to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kroguetrader/mods/146]Modfinder[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />If not using ModFinder, you will need to unzip the folder into your Game's Modifications folder.
